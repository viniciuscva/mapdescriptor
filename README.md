# Mapdescriptor

An Web app that generates a descriptive text for a given rectangular bounding box of a map with geographic features.
We employ Python Flask and Folium. An alternative method to Folium to generate the map visualization only containing filtered
POIs data is done by using a python script within the QGIS Software.
